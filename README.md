BrainStem is a biologically inspired, neuro-symbolic cognitive architecture for lifelong learning. It is designed to learn models of the structures and dynamics of language and text through context hypotheses, uncertainty, contradiction, revision, neuromodulation, replay, and consolidation rather than by merely storing isolated facts.

> BrainStem is a research and calibration system, not a production-ready assistant. Permanent fact, relation, and question writes remain locked while the learning core and its candidate flow are being validated.

## Current State

### Completed

- **Stage A — learning-core stabilization**
- sensory-deprivation drift test over **1,344 cycles**
- Legacy Cleanup large slices **A–C**
- removal of historical and unused learning paths
- removal of the obsolete `nlp.py` path and the legacy CorpusReader / Phase-3d word-role and filter path
- cleanup of the historical Phase-4def–4p cluster in favor of the canonical observation/signature path
- one canonical runtime chain through the current Phase-7cort top path
- all **12 digital neuromodulators** statically and at runtime connected to the GUI: **12/12, overall true**
- performance indexes and bounded pruning for approved history tables
- cooperative GUI worker shutdown
- bounded/downsampled GUI diagnostics and graphs
- database bootstrap and schema-contract consolidation

### Current Shadow Path

**Modern Gap Candidate Bridge + Bootstrap Shadow V1** is installed.

The bridge currently operates under the following restrictions:

- mode: `observed_only`
- execution: checkpoint-based
- maximum batch: **512 hypotheses per cycle**
- productive writes remain closed for:
  - `internal_learning_gaps`
  - attention targets
  - Phase-5f / Phase-5g / Phase-5i experiments
  - facts
  - relations
  - questions

Latest observed Shadow result:

| Signal | Result |
|---|---:|
| Phase-5i source rows | 0 |
| Shadow rows | 0 |
| Missing signals | none |
| Productive writes | `[0, 0]` |
| Mode | `shadow` |

These zero values are currently treated as a **measurement**, not automatically as a defect. The next investigation must determine whether no eligible Phase-5i candidates existed or whether an upstream path did not deliver candidates.

### Immediate Next Step

Before opening any productive write path, BrainStem will measure the missing candidate flow:

1. inspect the Phase-5i source
2. verify checkpoint behavior
3. verify candidate-selection conditions
4. verify the bootstrap/schema contract
5. demonstrate that the Shadow path processes real candidates

Only after this evidence exists will Stage B preparation continue.

## Core Philosophy

Traditional semantic systems often focus on the **what**: storing and retrieving content. BrainStem focuses on the **how**: learning how context, uncertainty, evidence, contradiction, revision, and consolidation interact over time.

A corpus is treated as training substrate rather than as a static knowledge base. The active learning architecture forms and revises context hypotheses, preserves errors as learning material, and delays permanent knowledge promotion until consolidation and safety gates are validated.

Core principles:

- **Learning before rules:** no fixed lexical blacklists or hand-authored word-role mappings in the active learning path.
- **Errors remain evidence:** unresolved and contradicted hypotheses remain available for later revision.
- **Consolidation before promotion:** permanent fact promotion stays closed until the staged write-gating design is validated.
- **Neuromodulation governs learning:** learning rate, error weighting, revision, confidence, exploration, inhibition, attention, stabilization, and consolidation are state-dependent.
- **Measure before changing:** diagnostics, audits, drift tests, and Shadow experiments precede active-control changes.
- **No hidden legacy paths:** obsolete modules and duplicate learning paths are removed rather than retained as inactive code.

## Architecture

### Two-Stage Data Pipeline

| Stage | Name | Description |
|---:|---|---|
| 1 | Inference-free pre-parsing | A raw corpus such as a Wikipedia ZIM file is extracted, structured, and partitioned into the chunk store before autonomous learning begins. |
| 2 | Autonomous learning | `AutonomousLoop` processes prepared chunks while the neuromodulatory and consolidation chain reacts to the evolving internal state. |

### Runtime Chain

Runtime phases are loaded through `ki_system/phase_registry.py`. The registry defines load order, isolates module-loading failures, and verifies the managed-cycle top phase.

Current chain, top to bottom:

`7cort Cortisol → 7g BDNF → 7f Orexin → 7e Histamine → 7d Slow-Wave → 7c E/I → 7b1 Wake-Chain Bridge → 7b Endocannabinoids → 7a Adenosine → 6d → 6c → 6b → 6a`

The cleaned chain uses Phase 7b1 as orchestrator so a normal global cycle produces one complete Phase-6a replay path, one Phase-7c E/I event, one Phase-7d cycle, and one workpoint-observer event.

## Digital Neuromodulator Cockpit

BrainStem currently uses **12 digital neuromodulators**. Their values are normalized to `[0.0, 1.0]` and derived from internal system state under bounded, biologically inspired dynamics and homeostatic constraints.

| Neuromodulator | Current engineering role |
|---|---|
| Dopamine | outcome and gap-closure signal |
| Serotonin | consolidation and stability signal |
| Glutamate | excitatory drive associated with exploration and learning activity |
| GABA | global inhibition and E/I-balance signal |
| Noradrenaline | error, alarm, and persistent-pressure signal |
| Acetylcholine | novelty, attention, and structural-revision signal |
| Adenosine | sleep-pressure homeostat |
| Endocannabinoids | retrograde gain control |
| Cortisol | top-level stability watcher and planned soft regulator |
| Histamine | wake and arousal signal |
| Orexin | reading-endurance and curiosity-related drive |
| BDNF | activity-dependent growth and consolidation substrate |

GABA currently regulates **system-level inhibition**. It does not identify or suppress individual words, relations, or extraction errors.

All 12 displays are connected both statically and at runtime in the GUI.

## Sleep, Consolidation, and Selection

### Sleep Replay and Critic Gate

Phase 6a performs offline-style replay after the wake path. Phase 6b evaluates replay effectiveness and plasticity adjustments. The critic gate checks whether proposed changes remain consistent enough to be retained; rejected or unstable material remains available as error and revision evidence.

### Slow-Wave Substructure

Phase 7d adds sub-1-Hz up/down-state processing with:

- stochastic reactivation
- adaptive thresholds
- activity-dependent participation
- survivor and weakening statistics
- anchor interleaving
- self-regulating down-selection

A passive Phase-7d workpoint observer records longitudinal E/I state, activity, survivor ratios, reference movement, and virtual adjustment proposals without applying them.

### E/I State Separation

The E/I path distinguishes:

- **Phase-6a drive:** `glutamate_drive` and `gaba_drive`
- **active Phase-7c state:** `glutamate_state` and `gaba_state`
- **compatibility mirror:** active values remain available to existing readers and GUI components
- **Shadow state:** non-applying recurrent candidates can be evaluated separately

This separation prevents Phase 6a from overwriting the active Phase-7c state on the next cycle.

## Stage B — Controlled Preparation

Stage B will not open all write capabilities at once. The controlled sequence is:

1. introduce Cortisol Stage 2 as a gentle regulator
2. validate it in observer operation before allowing applied control
3. allow only consolidation-gated graduation from `uncertain_hypothesis` to `stable_hypothesis`
4. require at least **three survived Phase-7d consolidations**
5. apply `_critic_gate`
6. use warm-up dampening
7. begin with a budget of **one promotion per cycle**
8. keep the facts table closed during the initial hypothesis-graduation stage
9. assess true fact promotion separately at a later milestone

Stage B remains blocked until the current Shadow bridge has demonstrably processed real candidates.

## Safety Locks

The following productive paths remain disabled:

- direct fact writes
- direct relation writes
- direct question writes
- permanent fact promotion
- direct Phase-5f / Phase-5g / Phase-5i experimental writes from the new bridge
- direct attention and internal-gap writes from the new bridge

The active architecture does not use word blacklists or hard-coded linguistic filters.

## Database and Schema Discipline

BrainStem uses `ki_memory.sqlite3` in the project root. The database is created automatically when absent.

Schema rules:

- schema changes must be reflected in the bootstrap in the same delivery
- `ensure_schema` must be idempotent
- `_self_check_schema` must run before writes
- every written column must already be declared in `SCHEMA_TABLES`
- compile checks, smoke tests, and intermediate checks are required before delivery
- structural changes require a full backup first

### Corpus-Preserving Learning Reset

Learning state can be reset without re-importing the corpus. Preserved content includes documents, chunks, FTS data, import state, and configuration. The reset workflow performs a dry run and creates a timestamped database backup before applying changes.

### Performance Maintenance

Performance indexes are ensured during bootstrap. Bounded pruning is limited to explicitly approved history tables. Active state, Phase-5f/5g/5i data, and other protected tables are excluded from generic pruning.

Periodic autonomous execution of the approved pruning routine remains an open maintenance item.

## Sensory Deprivation and Drift Report

The GUI includes a sensory-deprivation mode that skips new wake/read input while replay, consolidation, and neuromodulatory dynamics continue.

It provides:

- start and stop controls
- optional cycle limits
- per-cycle CSV diagnostics
- bounded/downsampled live graphs
- signal-level and overall drift verdicts
- fail-safe cleanup when the run completes or is interrupted

The completed **1,344-cycle** no-input test supported the Stage-A stability decision.

## Running the System

From the project root:

```cmd
python main.py --gui
```

### Basic Workflow

| Step | GUI action | Purpose |
|---:|---|---|
| 1 | Export / Configuration | Configure the maximum number of articles before import. |
| 2 | Import & Jobs → ZIM Einlesen | Extract and pre-parse the corpus. |
| 3 | Import & Jobs → Autonom dauerhaft starten | Start autonomous learning. |
| 4 | Import & Jobs → Autonom stoppen | Stop autonomous learning cooperatively. |
| 5 | Close the GUI normally | Wait for active workers instead of terminating them abruptly. |

### GUI Areas

- Import and Jobs
- Export and Configuration
- Drift Report
- live 12-neuromodulator display
- corpus-coverage and cycle-progress indicators
- bounded diagnostic logs and graphs
- cooperative worker shutdown

The GUI remains an experimental testing interface; individual areas may still be incomplete.

## ZIM Import

A Windows `zimdump.exe` build and its required DLL files must be placed in the project root next to `main.py`. Users must provide their own ZIM corpus.

The current development corpus is the German Wikipedia category **Computer**, imported into roughly 102,000 chunks.

## Development Notes

- **Python package:** `ki_system`
- **Local project folder:** `BrainStem`
- **Primary runtime:** Python 3.11 on Windows with SQLite
- **Documentation language:** English
- **Status:** highly experimental and under mathematical and architectural validation
- **Engineering discipline:** backup, compile check, schema self-check, smoke test, and rollback planning for structural changes
- **AI-assisted engineering:** development has included collaborative assistance from Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, and NotebookLM

After major refactorings, project documentation includes a Legacy Report with:

- removed legacy elements
- retained but explicitly marked elements

## Claims and Limitations

BrainStem does not claim that every current hypothesis is meaningful or that the system understands language at a human level. The current objective is to establish and validate the mechanisms by which hypotheses are formed, challenged, revised, inhibited, replayed, and consolidated.

Current zero-result Shadow measurements do not prove a defect and do not prove successful candidate processing. Candidate-flow evidence is the next required result.
